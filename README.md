Hi! I'm Andrei Craciun, a passionate Computer Science student at the Faculty of Applied Sciences (FSA), UPB (University Politehnica of Bucharest), Romania. I enjoy tackling problems in programming, especially in areas like C++, SQL, and game development.

Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of projects, including building scripts for gaming platforms like Onetap.su, and developing CS:GO/CS2 scripts with advanced features such as ESP, Anti-Aim modes, and FPS optimizations.

When I'm not coding, I like diving into game optimization, working on SQL databases, and exploring tools like CATIA for design and modeling.

I'm always open to learning new things, collaborating, and contributing to open-source projects. Feel free to check out my repositories, contribute, or just reach out to discuss cool tech stuff!
